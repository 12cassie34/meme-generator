## Overview
The exercise is from the course - Learn React for free created by Bob Ziroll from [Scriba](https://scrimba.com/).

### What I learned
In this exercise, I learned:
- Use `useState` to create variables, mutate them and let variables reactively change on web page.
- Use `useEffect` to call external APIs to avoid side effects in React.js
